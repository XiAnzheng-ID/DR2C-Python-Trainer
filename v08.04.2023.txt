Version 08.04.2023
Whats new?
- Added Unlimited Ammo for P2-P4
- Item Quantity Editor
- Fixed Ammo and Quantity Offset swapped when using Unlimited Ammo
- Removed Unlimited Battery ammo seems thats the culprit of bugged unlimited ammo
  but ill try to add it back when i found a workaround

MUST DO on first time run : type and run "pip install ReadWriteMemory" in python console
how to use? just run the main.py easy as that :D

Special Thanks to: 
-Steam User @guiLe(https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966239551)
 his tutorial help me a lot to study this game :D (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=749219319)

My Feature?:
-Player 1 First slot Invetory Editor (One and Only out there :D)
-Item Quantity Editor
-Unlimited Health & Ammo
-Stat Hack (In Progress)
-Manual Loot/Supply Editor

Note for stats :
base value i found 67109633 (use 256 increment value) or use 98300 for maximum value i can find
the data type probably long text or double based on my research
i cant hack some stat like speed as that nearly impossible to auto scan as there is no way
to change value in game like upgrade or training but i will try to find a workaround

Note for Quantity Editor:
DO NOT EDIT WHEN THERE IS NO ITEM AT FIRST INVENTORY SLOT (TOP LEFT CORNER)
just put your item/weapon you want to edit the Quantity number
on the first inventory slot (top left corner) 

Note for inventory editor: 
i was gonna put it at the first inventory slot (top left corner) 
but it seems glitch out the game a little bit (you can change this in the code if you prefer inventory slot)
Some items are set so they cannot be traded or dropped. Ex: the wand. 
so it can cause some bug or glitches you dont want to , or dont use this feature at all
as this can break your savedata BE CAREFULL
i havent list all the item ID so yeah you can try it your self(USE ANOTHER SAVESLOT OR DATA)
i found out the max item id is 229 beyond that is unusable item
